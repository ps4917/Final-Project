# Final-Project

This project extends an exploratory analysis of World Bank development indicators by shifting from descriptive patterns to a modeling task. Using country-level socio-economic indicators related to health, education, labor markets, and income, the project investigates their ability to predict short-run GDP growth. The focus is predictive rather than causal, emphasizing cross-country modeling using standard regression approaches.
